    <h2>Introduction: A Changing World</h2>
    <p>
      Today, we have many platforms that make building things easier. Whether it’s creating websites, videos, or even art, technology has simplified complex tasks. This raises a question: should we focus on learning to code perfectly, or should we spend more time thinking up new, creative ideas?
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Power of Easy-to-Use Platforms</h2>
    
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=No-Code+Platforms" alt="No-Code Platforms">
    
    <p>
      Platforms like GitHub Copilot, WordPress, and Canva allow people to create without needing deep technical knowledge. You don’t need to be a coding expert to launch a website or create digital content. The real challenge now is how to use these tools to make something new and impactful.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Why Innovation is More Important</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Technology Does the Hard Work</h3>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=AI+Powered+Tools" alt="AI Powered Tools">
    <p>
      Today, tools can handle much of the coding for us. What’s more important is knowing how to use these tools to bring creative ideas to life.
      <br><span class="highlight">Example:</span> AI platforms like OpenAI’s GPT or DALL·E allow anyone to build systems that used to require teams of expert coders.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2. Ideas Drive Progress</h3>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=Innovation+Drives+Progress" alt="Innovation Drives Progress">
    <p>
      Big ideas change the world. Things like the smartphone or social media weren’t just about writing code—they were about innovative thinking. While coding brings ideas to life, without new ideas, we wouldn’t move forward.
    </p>
    
    <h3>3. Solving Real Problems</h3>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=Problem+Solving+with+Technology" alt="Problem Solving with Technology">
    <p>
      The world faces big challenges like climate change and healthcare issues. These problems need creative solutions, not just technical skills. Innovation is what drives real change.
      <br><span class="highlight">Example:</span> AI is now helping doctors diagnose diseases faster. That wasn’t just because someone coded it well—it was because someone thought of using AI in a new way.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Future: Working with Machines</h2>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=Future+of+Technology" alt="Future of Technology">
    <p>
      As technology advances, people won’t need to know every coding detail. Instead, we’ll need to focus on coming up with ideas and designing solutions. Machines can do the heavy lifting, but we need to guide them with creativity and problem-solving skills.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion: Focus on Ideas, Not Just Skills</h2>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=Innovation+is+Key" alt="Innovation is Key">
    <p>
      Becoming the best coder is no longer the key to success. Instead, it’s about using technology to solve problems, create new things, and push boundaries. The future belongs to those who can think creatively and use the tools available to make their ideas happen.
