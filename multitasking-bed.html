    <h2>Multitasking Bed</h2>
    <p>This project focuses on developing an intelligent bed system to improve patient care through the use of AI and sensor technology. The Multitasking Bed is designed to address patient safety, enhance comfort, and streamline hospital operations.</p>
    <p><strong>Objectives:</strong> The primary aim of the Multitasking Bed is to enhance patient care by automating monitoring and adjusting the bed according to patient needs, allowing healthcare providers to prioritize critical tasks.</p>
    
    <h3>Design and Development</h3>
    <p>The system integrates four key elements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Patient Comfort and Safety:</strong> Equipped with sensors to monitor vital signs and adjust for optimal comfort.</li>
      <li><strong>Automated Alerts:</strong> Sends alerts to healthcare staff in case of abnormal readings, reducing response times.</li>
      <li><strong>Operational Efficiency:</strong> Automation of basic adjustments allows hospital staff to focus on essential care tasks.</li>
      <li><strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong> Simple controls make it easy for patients and staff to interact with the bed system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Vital Signs Monitoring:</strong> Tracks vital signs like heart rate and body temperature continuously.</li>
      <li><strong>Smart Positioning:</strong> Adjusts bed position to relieve pressure points and prevent bedsores.</li>
      <li><strong>Remote Monitoring:</strong> Allows staff to monitor patients from remote devices.</li>
      <li><strong>AI Integration:</strong> Uses predictive analysis to anticipate health issues before they become critical.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
    <p>Integrating sensors and ensuring smooth communication between hardware and software required rigorous testing. The project also prioritized compliance with healthcare standards for safety and data privacy, ensuring the system meets industry requirements.</p>

    <h3>Impact and Future Prospects</h3>
    <p>The Multitasking Bed not only aids in managing hospital resources efficiently but also enhances patient experiences by streamlining caregiving tasks. Future enhancements may include advanced AI for personalized care and expanded applications for home healthcare settings.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Technologies used:</strong> AI, IoT, Sensor Technology, Healthcare Systems</p>
